This could cause additional (usually avoidable) network requests to fetch data that were otherwise cached.

To address this problem (which is not a bug in Apollo Client), %sdefine a custom merge function for the %s field, so InMemoryCache can safely merge these objects:

  existing: %o
  incoming: %o

For more information about these options, please refer to the documentation:

  * Ensuring entity objects have IDs: https://go.apollo.dev/c/generating-unique-identifiers
